      with math-phisics-IT profile.Despite many road blocks on my education <br>
      path like pandemic and online learning,I never gave up and<br>
      succesfully passed all my crucial exams! All of that leads to me goingto <br>
      this university where new chapter of my life beginns…

      Since I can remember, I have been training swimming professionally.<br>
      I went to competitions and achieved good results. From the age of <br>
      fourteen I trained water polo. A sport in which the whole team has<br>
      to work together to win. Thanks to this, I have extensive experience<br>
      with working in a group and I can find myself there.
